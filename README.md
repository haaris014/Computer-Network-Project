# Computer-Network-Project
I used concepts of computer networks and Cisco Packet Tracer to design and implement a
network using Variable Length Subnet Masking (VLSM) and network address translation (NAT)
techniques. Using Cisco Packet Tracer, I configured network devices, implemented VLANs, and
configured routing protocols to ensure efficient data transmission and secure communication. I
also performed testing and troubleshooting to ensure network reliability and scalability.
Through this experience, I gained valuable expertise in computer network design, VLSM, NAT,
and Cisco Packet Tracer.
